# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## File structure

### Banner library

The banner library, that will be used to display banners on pre-existing web pages with a `<script>` tag is stored in the `lib/` folder.

This folder will be bundled as a `.js` file using [https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/](Rollup)

### Game module

The game modules is a `create-react-app` application, the sources files are stored in the `src` folder.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn start:lib`

Serves the `test_lib.html` file on a local url, usually [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

This URL won't auto refresh in case of changes either in the lib or in the html file.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`
Launch the commands `yarn build:app` and `yarn:build:lib`.
Note that `yarn:build:app` erases all content from the `build` folder, so any previous build of the library will be erased too

### `yarn build:app`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn build:lib`

Bundles the library from the `lib` folder to the `build` folder.
The `lib.js` file is meant to be used in a script tag, and will be invoked as an IIFE.

### `yarn build:lib:watch`

Watches changes in the `lib` folder and automatically re-build the lib


### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
